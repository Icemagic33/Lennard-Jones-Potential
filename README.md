# Lennard-Jones Potential Analysis

## Introduction

This project explores the Lennard-Jones potential, a mathematical model used to describe interactions between a pair of neutral atoms or molecules as a function of distance. This potential is instrumental in simulating the behavior of gases and liquids in molecular dynamics.

## Project Description

The Lennard-Jones potential is characterized by its ability to model both repulsive and attractive forces which are foundational in understanding molecular interactions. This project uses Python to simulate and analyze the behavior of molecules under the influence of this potential near their equilibrium positions. The analysis focuses on how small deviations from equilibrium can influence system dynamics, utilizing concepts from Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM).

## Features

- Calculation of the Lennard-Jones potential \( V(r) \)
- Force analysis derived from the potential
- Application of Taylor Expansion around the equilibrium position to simplify the potential
- Visualization of potential and force as functions of distance
- Simulation of particle behavior in the potential field using Python


## Usage
This project can be used as an educational tool to understand molecular dynamics, particularly the interactions governed by the Lennard-Jones potential. It can also serve as a basis for more complex simulations involving multiple particles and varying conditions.

## Simulation Results
The simulations demonstrate:

How the Lennard-Jones potential varies with distance between particles, showing a minimum at the equilibrium position where the system's energy is lowest.
The force profile, illustrating how it switches from repulsive to attractive, guiding the particles back towards equilibrium.
These visualizations help in comprehending the balance of forces in molecular systems and can be extended to study material properties in various states.

## Conclusion
This project enhances understanding of molecular dynamics through computational simulations, providing insights into fundamental physical properties that govern the behavior of atoms and molecules in different environments.
